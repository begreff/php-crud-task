### First things first

The database script is in `config/db.sql`.

Run the server with `php -S localhost:8080`

Run the tests with `phpunit  -c tests/phpunit.xml tests`

Everything should work as intended.

### Technology used

I used `PHP 7.4`, `MySQL`, `PHPUnit`, `JQuery` and `Bootstrap`.

I implemented the project without using a framework - being new to PHP, I wanted to learn it the hard way.

### Decisions made

I created a Repository class for each of the database entities. 

I also added Controller classes, which retrieve the data needed for the views via the repositories. They do not deal with the changes the user makes, as I haven't yet implemented a router.

The changes are dealt with by the code in `src/actions`.

Students are created/deleted by sending AJAX calls to a REST API.

### Reflection

The solution is not up to my standards - I prefer code that is clean and easy to understand, and parts of this are not.

I did, however, learn a lot. 

Not just PHP, but also PSR standards, composer, config files and such.

Working without a framework made me really appreciate just how much abstraction they offer.
